A Second Level Header
---------------------

Now is the time for all good men to come to
the aid of their country. This is just a
regular paragraph.

The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy
dog's back.

Some of these words *are emphasized*.
Some of these words _are emphasized also_.

Use two asterisks for **strong emphasis**.
Or, if you prefer, __use two underscores instead__.

*   Candy.
*   Gum.
*   Booze.
this:

+   Candy.
+   Gum.
+   Booze.
and this:

-   Candy.
-   Gum.
-   Booze.

1.  Red
2.  Green
3.  Blue

*   A list item.

    With multiple paragraphs.

I strongly recommend against using any `<blink>` tags.

I wish SmartyPants used named entities like `&mdash;`
instead of decimal-encoded entites like `&#8212;`.

  @property (nonatomic, copy) NSNumber *userID;
  @property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *username;
  @property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *text;
  @end
